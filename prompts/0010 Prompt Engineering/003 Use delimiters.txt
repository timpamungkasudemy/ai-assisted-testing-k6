Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden.
It was a large, lovely garden with soft green grass. Here and there stood beautiful flowers like stars over the grass, and twelve peach trees broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl in the springtime and bore rich fruit in the autumn. The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children stopped their games to listen. "How happy we are here!" they cried to each other.
One day, the Giant came back. He had been to visit his friend, the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years. After seven years, he had said all he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his castle. When he arrived, he saw the children playing in the garden.
"What are you doing here?" he cried gruffly, and the children ran away.
"My garden is my garden," said the Giant; "anyone can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself." So he built a high wall all around it and put up a notice-board: TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED
He was a very selfish Giant.
The poor children now had nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but it was dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. They wandered around the high wall when their lessons were over and talked about the beautiful garden inside. "How happy we were there," they said to each other.
Then the Spring came, and there were little blossoms and birds everywhere. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant was it still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once, a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice board, it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. "Spring has forgotten this garden," they cried, "so we will live here all the year round." The snow covered the grass with her great white cloak, and the frost painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney pots down. "This is a delightful spot," he said, "we must ask the Hail on a visit." So the Hail came. Every day for three hours, he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.
"I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming," said the Selfish Giant as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; "I hope there will be a change in the weather."
But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but she gave none to the Giant's garden. "He is too selfish," she said. So it was always winter there, and the North Wind, the Hail, the Frost, and the snow danced about through the trees.
One morning, the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by.
It was only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. "I believe the Spring has come at last," said the Giant, and he jumped out of bed and looked out.
What did he see?
He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall, the children had crept in, sitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see, there was a little child. And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers looked up through the green grass and laughed. It was a lovely scene, but winter was still in one corner. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and a little boy stood there. He was so small that he could not reach the tree branches and wandered around them, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind blew and roared above it. "Climb up! Little boy," said the tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could, but the boy was too tiny.
And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out. "How selfish I have been!" he said; "now I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever." He was very sorry for what he had done.
So he crept downstairs, opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him, they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming. And the Giant stole up behind him, gently took him in his hand, and put him into the tree. And the tree broke into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms, flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him. And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was no longer wicked, came running back, and the Spring came with them. "It is your garden now, little children," said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. And when the people went to the market at noon, they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.
All day long, they played, and in the evening, they came to the Giant to bid him goodbye.
"But where is your little companion?" he said: "the boy I put into the tree." The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.
"We don't know," answered the children; "he has gone away."
"You must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow," said the Giant. But the children said they did not know where he lived and had never seen him before, and the Giant felt very sad.
The children played with the Giant every afternoon when school was over. But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.
The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend and often spoke of him. "How I would like to see him!" he used to say.
Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, watched the children at their games, and admired his garden. "I have many beautiful flowers," he said, "but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all."
One winter morning, he looked out his window as he dressed. He did not hate the winter now, for he knew it was merely the Spring asleep and the flowers were resting.
Suddenly, he rubbed his eyes in wonder and looked and looked. It certainly was a marvelous sight. In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.
Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy and out into the garden. He hastened across the grass and came near to the child. And when he came quite close, his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?" For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two were on the little feet.
"Who hath dared to wound thee?" cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him."
"Nay!" answered the child, "but these are the wounds of Love."
"Who art thou?" said the Giant and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.
The child smiled at the Giant and said, "You const me play once in your garden. Today, you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."
And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.
