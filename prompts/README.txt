The prompts folders are ordered by their appearance in courses, but their number might differ from the lecture number.

For example:

  - folder 020 ABC 
  - folder 030 XYZ 

Such folder names do not mean "ABC" for lecture 20 of the course or "XYZ" for lecture 30. 
But it indicates that "ABC" appears in the lecture before "XYZ".

The titles ("ABC" and "XYZ") might be slightly different from the lectures in the course.

Each folder will contain one or more prompts used in the particular lecture, but the sequence might 
be different from how they appear in a particular course's lecture.
