Generate a K6 test script with five fixed users. The script should run for 5 minutes and test the following endpoint.
```
curl -L 'https://api.mycompany.com/extract-data/v3/passport' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "image_base64": "<base64-image>"
}'
```
The expected metrics are:
response status code is 200
P95 response time is less than 1 second
