### Step 1
Extract the items stated in the chat. Each item will contain the item name, price (in USD), barcode, manufacturer, and item type (frozen/packed/fresh)
###
### Step 2
Convert each item to an SQL statement that inserts into the PostgreSQL table "products." The "items" table has the following fields:
<field>product_id : random UUID</field>
<field>product_name: this should be the item name, all uppercase</field>
<field>manufacturer_name: this should be the manufacturer name, all uppercase</field>
<field>price: this should be the item price, rounded to two decimals</field>
<field>barcode: this should be the item barcode, all uppercase</field>
<field>item_type: this should be the item type (FROZEN / FRESH / PACKED / OTHER), all uppercase</field>
###
### Step 3
Give me all the SQL insert statements as output and nothing else.
