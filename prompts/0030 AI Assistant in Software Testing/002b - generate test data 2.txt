<story>
As an e-commerce user, I'd like to pay using a credit card. The credit card issuer can be Visa or Mastercard. I must enter the following: credit card number, cardholder name, CVV, and amount to be paid.
The currency code will always be USD.
If the amount to be paid is over 100 USD, I can choose whether to pay in full (without a loan) or use a loan with a 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 months tenure.
